# Design Patterns

I created a token system which rewards users who contribute the most to the platform and can even redeem those tokens for other courses they can then take. The creators get 100% of the profits and a stake in the success of the overall ecosystem as a reward. 

Working through this smart contract and using cryptocurrency & tokens instead of cash & credit, it forces you to think about human incentive and why users would use your app over others. Taking a new approach to the seller/buyer relationship needing to trust a 3rd party intermediary, Educoin attempts to reward its' users with token when contributing valuable content to the platform and allowing its' users to receive 100% of the profits from course sales which no other platform currently does. 

As the application is currently structured to remove the roadblock of using cash to buy ether, setup a metamask account, save the seed phrase and then paying for the transactions gas costs, the user is rewarded for each of those steps at signup with 100 EDU tokens which they can then be used to purchase and watch another user created course right away. The main hurdle in getting users to switch from a regular centralized platform like Udemy or Youtube, you must provide a clearly better solution and make it clear on how to use said platform. With Educoin there is a clear advantage in giving users 100% of their profits and rewarding them right away for contributing new courses to the platform but steps still need to be taken to ease the intro into the blockchain world.
